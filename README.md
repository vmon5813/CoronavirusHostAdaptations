# CoronavirusHostAdaptations

The data in this repository corresponds to the manuscript: "Variable routes to genomic and host adaptation among coronaviruses"

It consists of three data files and one set of tables:

1) SupplementaryTable3.csv

The Genbank accession ids as well as the GISAID ids for the sequences used in the study

2) SupplementaryTable4.csv

The column headers are:

Analysis: selection analysis,

Host: host species for which virus was isolated from,

Virus: virus species name,

Gene: gene used in selection analysis,

Position: codon position of gene

PositiveSel: p-value of analysis for position,

Pos-Significance: proportion of trees supporting selection,

Branches: branches supproting selection (MEME),

Within10Glycan: the positions of the spike protein which are within 10 angstroms of a glycosylation site ("Within10") or not ("Outside")

3) SupplementaryTable5.csv

The parameter estimates for the FEL analyses in this study

4) gisaid_hcov-19_acknowledgement_table_Dec2019-Jun13.pdf

Acknowledgement tables for the GISAID sequences used in this study
